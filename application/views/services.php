	<p>Divorce or dissolution of marriage is a legal process that leads to
		the termination of a marriage. Divorce laws vary considerably around
		the world. Divorce is not permitted in some countries, such as in
		Malta and in the Philippines, though an annulment is permitted.
		Unfortunately for some of us the joy of marriage doesn&#39;t last
		forever, or future plans do not come out as hoped and living together
		becomes intolerable. When compatibility no longer exists and
		differences can not be reconciled, the strain on one&#39;s personal
		life can and often is severe. Divorce is not always the solution, but
		when it is choosing the correct attorney to navigate and litigate you
		through your divorce can&#39;t be overemphasized or understated.
		Sometimes the decision to part is joint and mutual and a cooperative
		divorce arrangement is desired. Other times a stronger and more
		aggressive approach is necessary for especially difficult spouses.
		Whatever your situation, however difficult your spouse may be, you can
		contact us for best consultation for all types of divorce and child
		custody, which is generally considered by most lawyers to fall under
		the broad category of Family Law.</p>

	<p>The legal process for divorce may also involve issues of spousal
		support, child custody, child support, distribution of property and
		division of debt, though these matters are usually only ancillary or
		consequential to the dissolution of the marriage.</p>

	<p>In some jurisdictions divorce does not require a party to claim
		fault of their partner that leads to the breakdown of marriage. But
		even in jurisdictions which have adopted the &quot;no fault&quot;
		principle in divorce proceedings, a court may still take into account
		the behaviour of the parties when dividing property, debts, evaluating
		custody, and support.</p>

	<p>Going through a divorce or separation is often the single worst
		event that people experience in their entire life. Clients are often
		making some of the most important and difficult decisions during times
		when they are at their most fragile and vulnerable.</p>

	<p>
		<b>Child custody:</b> One of the most painful and difficult issue,
		today is child custody. From divorcing cases to fight for their right
		on their child, the trouble is paramount. The child custody battles
		flares up as parents compete for the right to spend time with the
		kids. These battles can put undue strain on everyone involved, but
		especially the children. That&#39;s why it&rsquo;s so important to
		understand all of your legal rights concerning child custody and how
		to use the court systems to obtain mutually acceptable arrangements.
		We provide these solutions in a very humble and cooperative manner and
		create a healthy enviourment.
